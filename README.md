### Demo test for the Machine Learning Engineer Position

The Exploratory Data Analysis report has given in the ```experiments/EDA.ipynb``` file. The ```experiments/ml.ipynb``` file shows the experiments training, evaluation with different ML models, GridSearch for finding the best model and hyperparameter tuning. The Question asked to focus on simplicity and effectiveness. That's why I started from Machine Learning models and thought to explore the Deep Learning and transformer models. But I get enough good performance with simple machine learning models.
